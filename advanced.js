// Q1. makeCounter below is a decorator function which creates and returns a function that increments a counter.
// a) Create a second counter counter2 using the makeCounter function and test to see if it remains independent to counter1
// b) Modify makeCounter so that it takes an argument startFrom specifying where the counter starts from (instead of always starting from 0)
// c) Modify makeCounter to take another argument incrementBy, which specifies how much each call to counter() should increase the counter value by. 
function makeCounter() { 
    let currentCount = 0; 
    return function() { 
        currentCount++; 
        console.log(currentCount) 
        return currentCount; 
    }; 
} 

let counter1 = makeCounter(); 
counter1(); // 1 
counter1(); // 2

// Q2. The following delayMsg function is intended to be used to delay printing a message until some time has passed.
// a) What order will the four tests below print in? Why?
// b) Rewrite delayMsg as an arrow function
// c) Add a fifth test which uses a large delay time (greater than 10 seconds) d) Use clearTimeout to prevent the fifth test from printing at all. 
function delayMsg(msg) { 
    console.log(`This message will be printed after a delay: ${msg}`) 
} 

setTimeout(delayMsg, 100, '#1: Delayed by 100ms'); 
setTimeout(delayMsg, 20, '#2: Delayed by 20ms'); 
setTimeout(delayMsg, 0, '#3: Delayed by 0ms'); 
delayMsg('#4: Not delayed at all')

// Q3. 'Debouncing' is a concept that refers to 'putting off' the execution of multiple, fast-timed, 
// similar requests until there's a brief pause, then only executing the most recent of those requests. 
// See https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/debouncing
// It's often used to handle fast-firing scrolling events in a browser, or to prevent multiple server 
// requests being initiated if a user clicks repeatedly on a button.
//Using the following code to test and start with:
// a) Create a debounce(func) decorator, which is a wrapper that takes a function func and suspends calls to func until there's 1000 milliseconds of inactivity. After this 1 second pause, the most recent call to func should be executed and any others ignored.
// b) Extend the debounce decorator function to take a second argument ms, which defines the length of the period of inactivity instead of hardcoding to 1000ms
// c) Extend debounce to allow the original debounced function printMe to take an argument msg which is included in the console.log statement. 
function printMe() { 
    console.log('printing debounced message') 
} 

printMe = debounce(printMe); //create this debounce function for a) //fire off 3 calls to printMe within 300ms - only the LAST one should print, after 1000ms of no calls 
setTimeout( printMe, 100); 
setTimeout( printMe, 200); 
setTimeout( printMe, 300);


// Q4. The Fibonacci sequence of numbers is a famous pattern where the next number in the 
// sequence is the sum of the previous 2.
// e.g. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc.
// a) Write a function printFibonacci() using setInterval that outputs a number in the Fibonacci sequence every second.
// b) Write a new version printFibonacciTimeouts() that uses nested setTimeout calls to do the same thing 
// c) Extend one of the above functions to accept a limit argument, which tells it how many numbers to print before stopping.


// Q5. The following car object has several properties and a method which uses them to print 
// a description. When calling the function normally this works as expected, but using it from 
// within setTimeout fails. Why?
let car = { 
    make: "Porsche", 
    model: '911', 
    year: 1964, 
    description() {
      console.log(`This car is a ${this.make} ${this.model} from ${this.year}`); 
    } 
}; 

car.description(); //works setTimeout(car.description, 200); //fails

// a) Fix the setTimeout call by wrapping the call to car.description() inside a function
// b) Change the year for the car by creating a clone of the original and overriding it
// c) Does the delayed description() call use the original values or the new values from b)? Why?
// d) Use bind to fix the description method so that it can be called from within setTimeout without a wrapper function
// e) Change another property of the car by creating a clone and overriding it, and test that setTimeout still uses the bound value from d)


// Q6. Use the Function prototype to add a new delay(ms) function to all functions, which can
// be used to delay the call to that function by ms milliseconds. function multiply(a, b) { console.log( a * b ); } multiply.delay(500)(5, 5); // prints 25 after 500 milliseconds
// a) Use the example multiply function below to test it with, as above, and assume that all delayed functions will take two parameters
// b) Use apply to improve your solution so that delayed functions can take any number of parameters
// c) Modify multiply to take 4 parameters and multiply all of them, and test that your delay prototype function still works.


// Q7. In JavaScript, the toString method is used to convert an object to a string representation.
// By default, when an object is converted to a String, it returns a string that looks something like [object Object].
// However, we can define our own toString methods for custom objects to provide a more meaningful string representation.
// a) Define a custom toString method for the Person object that will format and print their details
// b) Test your method by creating 2 different people using the below constructor function and printing them
// c) Create a new constructor function Student that uses call to inherit from Person and add an extra property cohort
// d) Add a custom toString for Student objects that formats and prints their details. Test with 2 students. 

function Person(name, age, gender) { 
    this.name = name; 
    this.age = age; 
    this.gender = gender; 
} 

const person1 = new Person('James Brown', 73, 'male') 
console.log('person1: '+person1) //prints person1: [object Object]

// Q8. The following DigitalClock class uses an interval to print the time every second once started, until stopped. 
class DigitalClock { 
    constructor(prefix) { 
        this.prefix = prefix; 
    } 
    
    display() { 
        let date = new Date(); 
        //create 3 variables in one go using array destructuring 
        let [hours, mins, secs] = [date.getHours(), date.getMinutes(), date.getSeconds()]; 
        if (hours < 10) hours = '0' + hours; 
        if (mins < 10) mins = '0' + mins; 
        if (secs < 10) secs = '0' + secs; 
        
        console.log(`${this.prefix} ${hours}:${mins}:${secs}`); 
    } 
    stop() { 
        clearInterval(this.timer); 
    } 
    
    start() { 
        this.display(); 
        this.timer = setInterval(() => this.display(), 1000); 
    } 
} 

const myClock = new DigitalClock('my clock:') 
myClock.start()

// a) Create a new class PrecisionClock that inherits from DigitalClock and adds the parameter precision – the number of ms between 'ticks'. This precision parameter should default to 1 second if not supplied.
// b) Create a new class AlarmClock that inherits from DigitalClock and adds the parameter wakeupTime in the format hh:mm. When the clock reaches this time, it should print a 'Wake Up' message and stop ticking. This wakeupTime parameter should default to 07:00 if not supplied.


// Q9. We can delay execution of a function using setTimeout, where we need to provide the callback function to be executed after the delay.
// a) Create a promise-based alternative randomDelay() that delays execution for a random amount of time (between 1 and 20 seconds) and returns a promise we can use via .then(), as in the starter code below
// b) If the random delay is even, consider this a successful delay and resolve the promise, and if the random number is odd, consider this a failure and reject it
// c) Update the testing code to catch rejected promises and print a different message
// d) Try to update the then and catch messages to include the random delay value
function randomDelay() { // your code 
} 
randomDelay().then(() => console.log('There appears to have been a delay.'));

// Q10. Fetch is a browser-based function to send a request and receive a response from a server, 
// which uses promises to handle the asynchronous response. 
// The below fetchURLData uses fetch to check the response for a successful status code, and returns a promise containing the JSON sent by the remote server if successful or an error if it failed. (To run this code in a node.js environment, follow the instructions in the comments before the function.)
// a) Write a new version of this function using async/await
// b) Test both functions with valid and invalid URLs. 

//run 'npm init' and accept all the defaults 
//run 'npm install node-fetch' 
//add this line to package.json after line 5: "type": "module", 
import fetch from 'node-fetch' 
globalThis.fetch = fetch 

function fetchURLData(url) {
